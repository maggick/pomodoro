# Pomodoro rocks

A simple pomodoro timer wrote with [electron](http://electron.atom.io).

The goal is to know where your time goes.
This can be useful for freelancers, open source developers, non-profit
organizations and even companies.

## Development

### Dependencies

 * NodeJS
 * Electron
    npm install electron-prebuilt -g

#### Node Timer

The [countdown of node timer](https://github.com/malinkie/node-timers/blob/master/countdown.js)
is bugged, I opened a [pull request](https://github.com/malinkie/node-timers/pull/2)
regarding it but it was not accepted yet. YOU need to manually fix the code to
avoid the headache.
